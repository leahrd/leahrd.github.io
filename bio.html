  <h1>My Bio</h1>
  <p>My name is Leah.  In my free time I enjoy hiking, kayaking, cooking, and reading.  I graduated from Wheaton College with a major in Biology but after working in BioTech for some time, I decided I'd like to try learning how to code.  When I got home after work, I would spend my free time learning to code through CodeAcademy and later Coursera courses.  I enjoyed learning to code so much that I decided to enroll in the Tufts Computer Science Post-Bac program! </p>
