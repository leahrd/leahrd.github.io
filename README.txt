I have implemented 3 html files: index.html, resume.html, and bio.html.  I have also implemented one css file: style.css
I spent a lot of my time trying to get the image to load and I was finally able to figure it out.  I didn't discuss this assignment with anyone but I did utilize w3schools.com and stack overflow.

I spent approximately four hours on this assignment.
